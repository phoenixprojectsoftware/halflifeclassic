# Half-Life Classic — Version `1.5`
## CHANGELOG
- **ADDITION** Added `sv_german <0|1>` command. Setting to `1` and a map restart removes blood effects and changes all monster models to their respective German-version counterparts.
- **ADDITION** Restored the Gluon Gun Flare (a.k.a. "energy cloud").
- **ADDITION** Restored random pitch modulation on the Crowbar swing sound.
- **ENHANCEMENT** Added Day One models with higher-resolution textures. (thanks @Davedson-debug)
- **ENHANCEMENT** Bobtilt & client-side are deactivated in multiplayer to prevent cheating.
- **ENHANCEMENT** Autojump is no longer forced on. It is now tied to a `cl_autojump <0|1>` command.
- **REMOVAL** Removed the "(2020)" from the game title.
